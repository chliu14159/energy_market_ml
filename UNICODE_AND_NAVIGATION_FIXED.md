# Unicode Error and Navigation Issues Fixed ✅

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. Unicode Decode Error
**Problem**: `UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xca in position 5`
**Root Cause**: Dashboard file had corrupted encoding (showed as "data" instead of text)
**Solution**: 
- Removed corrupted file
- Recreated with proper UTF-8 encoding
- Simplified content to avoid encoding issues

### 2. Main Tab Visibility 
**Problem**: "main" tab was showing in sidebar navigation
**Root Cause**: Streamlit always shows `main.py` as "main" in multipage apps
**Solution**:
- Renamed `main.py` → `00_🏠_Home.py` (proper page format)
- Created minimal `main.py` with redirect message
- Now shows as "🏠 Home" in navigation

## 🏗️ New Clean Structure

```
app/
├── main.py                    # Minimal redirect page
├── 00_🏠_Home.py             # Professional landing page
