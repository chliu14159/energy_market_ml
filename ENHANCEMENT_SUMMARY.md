# Retail Pricing and Load App Enhancement Summary

## 🧹 Cleanup Completed

### Removed Files:
- `debug_datetime.py`, `debug_features.py` - Debug scripts no longer needed
- `quick_test.py`, `super_quick_test.py`, `test_*.py` - Test files moved to development workflow
- `app/pages/01_📊_Dashboard.py.backup` - Old backup file
- `external_toolkit/` - Duplicated forecasting components (already in backend/)
- All status markdown files (`CLEANUP_COMPLETE.md`, `DEPRECATION_NOTICE.md`, etc.)

### Cleaned Structure:
